# enviroCar Code Challenge

## Introduction
enviroCar is a citizen science community that collects, shares, and analyzes floating car data for traffic management and the environment. It analyzes the open data and estimates the track count, average speed, relative speed, CO2 emission, fuel consumption, and hotspot analysis.

<br>

The user should be able to control his private and location-based data so this project aims to build a simple UI that informes the user about the collected data and also lets the user check one or two data collection options.
